### AI & No-Code Recipe Builder Roadmap

#### 1. Define the Goal
- **Objective**: Create a user-friendly recipe builder that leverages AI to suggest ingredients and instructions while allowing users to customize recipes easily without coding.

#### 2. Choose AI Tools and No-Code Platforms
- **AI Tools**:
  - OpenAI GPT: [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/)
  - Clarifai: [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/)
  - Dialogflow: [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/)
  - NLP Cloud: [NLP Cloud](https://nlpcloud.io/)

- **No-Code Platforms**:
  - Bubble: [Bubble](https://bubble.io/)
  - Zapier: [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)
  - Airtable: [Airtable](https://airtable.com/)
  - Thunkable: [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com/)

#### 3. Design the User Flow
1. **User Sign-Up/Log-In**:
   - Users sign up or log in to access the recipe builder.
   - Use Bubbleâ€™s authentication features for user management.

2. **Recipe Input**:
   - Users can input ingredients they have or upload images of ingredients.
   - Use Clarifai for image recognition to identify ingredients.

3. **Recipe Suggestions**:
   - GPT generates recipe suggestions based on user input.
   - Display suggestions with options for customization.

4. **Recipe Customization**:
   - Users can modify suggested recipes (e.g., changing ingredients, adjusting quantities).
   - Use GPT for generating instructions dynamically based on modifications.

5. **Recipe Saving and Sharing**:
   - Users can save recipes to their profile (stored in Airtable).
   - Option to share recipes via social media or email (integrated with Zapier).

6. **Conversational Interface**:
   - Integrate Dialogflow to allow users to interact with the recipe builder using natural language.

7. **Mobile App Integration**:
   - Use Thunkable to create a mobile app version that syncs with the web application.

#### 4. Implement the Backend and Integrations
- **Database Setup**:
  - Use Airtable to create tables for storing user profiles, ingredients, and recipes.

- **API Integrations**:
  - Integrate OpenAI GPT for generating text content.
  - Use Clarifaiâ€™s API for image recognition.
  - Connect Dialogflow for conversational AI.
  - Use Zapier to automate data flow between Bubble, Airtable, and other services.

#### 5. Build the Frontend
- **Web Application (Bubble)**:
  - Design the UI using Bubbleâ€™s drag-and-drop editor.
  - Create pages for user login, recipe input, suggestions, customization, and profile management.

- **Mobile Application (Thunkable)**:
  - Design the mobile UI and ensure it syncs with the web app.
  - Implement features for viewing, editing, and sharing recipes.

#### 6. Test and Launch
- **Testing**:
  - Conduct thorough testing of the web and mobile applications.
  - Ensure all integrations and AI functionalities work seamlessly.

- **Launch**:
  - Deploy the web application on Bubble.
  - Publish the mobile app on relevant app stores (Google Play, Apple App Store).

#### 7. Post-Launch Activities
- **User Feedback**:
  - Collect user feedback to identify areas for improvement.
  - Implement necessary updates based on feedback.

- **Marketing and Promotion**:
  - Use social media, email campaigns, and other marketing strategies to promote the recipe builder.

- **Maintenance**:
  - Regularly update the AI models and no-code platform configurations to ensure optimal performance.

This document provides a clear and concise roadmap for building your AI & no-code recipe builder using GPT-Engineer.

## Collaborate with GPT Engineer

This is a [gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app)-synced repository ðŸŒŸðŸ¤–

Changes made via gptengineer.app will be committed to this repo.

If you clone this repo and push changes, you will have them reflected in the GPT Engineer UI.

## Tech stack

This project is built with React and Chakra UI.

- Vite
- React
- Chakra UI

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GPT-Engineer-App/recipe-assistant-builder.git
cd recipe-assistant-builder
